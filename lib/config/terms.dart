            <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

            <p>All rights, title and interest in intellectual property rights relating to the Products including copyright, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, improvements, developments, proprietary information, know-how, processes, methods, business plans or models (including computer software and preparatory and design materials thereof) and all other intellectual property (whether registered or not) developed or created from time to time shall exclusively be owned by Good e-Learning. While you may utilise the intellectual property, you understand that there shall be no transfer of ownership of the same. </p>
            <p>Nothing that you see or read in the Products may be copied, reproduced, modified, distributed, transmitted, republished, displayed or performed for commercial use. </p>
            <p>All other trademarks, service marks and trade names in this material are the marks of the respective owners and any unauthorised use is prohibited. </p>

            <a class="anchor" id="damages"></a>
            <h2>Loss or Damages</h2>

            <p>We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us. If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it is either obvious that it will happen or if we are both aware it might happen, such as where you have discussed the possibility with us during the sales process. </p>
            <p>We are not liable to you in any way for any indirect, special, incidental, punitive or consequential damages of any character, including without limitation damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data, loss of productivity or contract or any and all other commercial damages or losses. </p>
            <p>We do not exclude or limit our liability to you in any case where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the products (summarised above at 6). </p>
            <p>If the Products damage your device or digital content belonging to you and this is caused by our failure to use reasonable care and skill, we will either repair the damage or pay you compensation. However, we will not be liable for damage which you could have avoided by following our advice, following installation/download instructions, or having in place the minimum system requirements as advised by us. </p>
            <p>Our liability to you for any damage to your computer system or loss of data resulting from the downloading of content is limited to the amount you have paid for the Products. In no event shall we be liable for damages in excess of this sum. </p>

            <h2>Other Terms</h2>

            <p>You need our consent to transfer your rights under these terms to someone else. We may not agree to this as these terms grant a licence for your benefit only. </p>
            <p>Nobody else has any rights under these terms – they are between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms. </p>
            <p>If a court finds part of these terms illegal, then rest will continue in force. </p>
            <p>Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. </p>

            <h2>Governing law</h2>

            <p>These terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales and you can bring legal proceedings in the English courts. If you live in Scotland, you can bring legal proceedings in either the Scottish or English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland, you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Northern Irish or the English courts. </p>
